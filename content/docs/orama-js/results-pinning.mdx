title: Results Pinning (Merchandising)
description: Pin specific documents to a chosen position in the search results.
---

Starting with Orama v3.1.16, you can pin specific documents to a chosen position in the search results. This feature is particularly useful for merchandising purposes, allowing you to highlight certain items or promotions.

## Creating a Pinning Rule

To get started with results pinning, you need to create a pinning rule. A pinning rule consists of the following components:

- `id`: A unique identifier for the pinning rule.
- `conditions`: One or more conditions that determine when the rule applies.
- `consequence`: The action to take when the conditions are met, such as pinning specific documents to certain positions.

The API is pretty simple, here is an example of how to create a pinning rule:

```ts
import { create, insertMultiple, search, insertPin } from '@orama/orama'

const db = create({
  schema: {
    title: 'string',
    description: 'string'
  } as const
})

insertMultiple(db, [
  { id: '1', title: 'Red Shirt', description: 'A red shirt' },
  { id: '2', title: 'Blue Jeans', description: 'Blue denim jeans' },
  { id: '3', title: 'Green Hat', description: 'A green hat' }
])

insertPin(db, { // [!code highlight]
  id: 'pin_blue_jeans', // [!code highlight]
  conditions: [{ anchoring: 'contains', pattern: 'shirt' }], // [!code highlight]
  consequence: { // [!code highlight]
    promote: [{ doc_id: '3', position: 0 }] // [!code highlight]
  } // [!code highlight]
}) // [!code highlight]

const results = search(db, { term: 'shirt' })
```

In the example above, we're inserting three documents:

1. Red Shirt
2. Blue Jeans
3. Green Hat

And without a pinning rule, searching for "shirt" would return one single result:

```json
{
  "hits": [
    { "id": "1", "title": "Red Shirt", "description": "A red shirt" }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

But since we added a pinning rule that promotes the "Green Hat" to the first position whenever the search term contains "shirt", the search results will now look like this:

```json
{
  "hits": [
    { "id": "3", "title": "Green Hat", "description": "A green hat" },
    { "id": "1", "title": "Red Shirt", "description": "A red shirt" }
  ],
  "count": 2
}
```

As you can see, the pinned document will not replace the original results: they will just slide down to make room for the pinned document, so take that into account when choosing multiple pinning positions.

## Using Multiple Conditions

When defining multiple conditions in a pinning rule, all conditions must be met for the rule to apply. For example:

```ts
insertPin(db, {
  id: 'winter_jacket_rule',
  conditions: [
    { anchoring: 'contains', pattern: 'winter' },
    { anchoring: 'contains', pattern: 'jacket' }
  ],
  consequence: { promote: [{ doc_id: 'featured-jacket', position: 0 }] }
})
```

- ✅ Matches: "winter jacket" (contains both `"winter"` AND `"jacket"`)
- ✅ Matches: "buy winter jacket now" (contains both)
- ✅ Matches: "jacket for winter" (contains both, order doesn't matter)
- ❌ Does NOT match: "winter coat" (missing `"jacket"`)
- ❌ Does NOT match: "leather jacket" (missing `"winter"`)

At the moment, all the conditions are implicitly `AND`ed together. Future versions may introduce support for `OR` conditions, if you have a use case for that, please let us know on [GitHub](https://github.com/oramasearch/orama/issues).

## Condition Anchoring Options

When defining conditions for pinning rules, you can specify how the search term should match the pattern using different anchoring options. Here are the available options:

### `is` - Exact Match.

```js
{ anchoring: 'is', pattern: 'blue jeans' }
```

- ✅ Matches: "blue jeans" (exact, case-insensitive)
- ✅ Matches: "Blue Jeans" (case-insensitive)
- ❌ Does NOT match: "blue jeans jacket"
- ❌ Does NOT match: "blue"

### `starts_with` - Prefix Match

```js
{ anchoring: 'starts_with', pattern: 'blue' }
```

- ✅ Matches: "blue" (exact)
- ✅ Matches: "blue jeans" (starts with `"blue"`)
- ✅ Matches: "blueberry pie" (starts with `"blue"`)
- ❌ Does NOT match: "navy blue" (doesn't start with `"blue"`)

### `contains`: Substring Match

```js
{ anchoring: 'contains', pattern: 'blue' }
```

- ✅ Matches: "blue" (exact)
- ✅ Matches: "blue jeans" (contains `"blue"`)
- ✅ Matches: "navy blue" (contains `"blue"`)
- ✅ Matches: "blueberry" (contains `"blue"`)
- ❌ Does NOT match: "red shirt" (doesn't contain `"blue"`)

### Combining Conditions

You can always combine multiple conditions and they will operate as an `AND`:

```js
insertPin(db, {
  id: 'specific_search',
  conditions: [
    { anchoring: 'starts_with', pattern: 'buy' },          // Must start with "buy"
    { anchoring: 'contains',    pattern: 'winter' },       // Must contain "winter"
    { anchoring: 'contains',    pattern: 'jacket' }        // Must contain "jacket"
  ],
  consequence: { promote: [{ doc_id: 'featured', position: 0 }] }
})
```

This would match:
- ✅ "buy winter jacket"
- ✅ "buy a warm winter jacket"
- ✅ "buy jacket for winter"
- ❌ "winter jacket to buy" (doesn't start with `"buy"`)

## Consequence Options

Currently, the only available consequence is `promote`, which allows you to pin specific documents to chosen positions in the search results. The `promote` array consists of objects with the following properties:

- `doc_id`: The ID of the document to pin.
- `position`: The zero-based position in the search results where the document should be pinned.

You can pin multiple documents in a single rule, just make sure to assign different positions to each document:

```ts
insertPin(db, {
  id: 'holiday_specials',
  conditions: [{ anchoring: 'contains', pattern: 'holiday' }],
  consequence: {
    promote: [
      { doc_id: 'special-offer-1', position: 0 },
      { doc_id: 'special-offer-2', position: 1 },
      { doc_id: 'special-offer-3', position: 2 }
    ]
  }
})
```

## Updating a Pinning Rule

To update an existing pinning rule, you can use the `updatePin` function. This function allows you to modify the conditions or consequences of a rule by specifying its `id`.

```ts
import { updatePin } from '@orama/orama'

updatePin(db, {
  id: 'pin_blue_jeans',
  conditions: [{ anchoring: 'contains', pattern: 'jeans' }], // Updated condition
  consequence: {
    promote: [{ doc_id: '2', position: 0 }] // Updated consequence
  }
})
```

When updating a pinning rule, make sure to provide the complete rule definition, as the existing rule will be replaced with the new one.

## Deleting a Pinning Rule

To delete a pinning rule, you can use the `deletePin` function by specifying the `id` of the rule you want to remove.

```ts
import { deletePin } from '@orama/orama'

deletePin(db, 'pin_blue_jeans')
```

## Listing All Pinning Rules

You can retrieve a list of all existing pinning rules using the `listPins` function. This function returns an array of pinning rules currently defined in the database.

```ts
import { getAllRules } from '@orama/orama'

const rules = getAllRules(db)
```

This will return an array of all pinning rules, allowing you to review or manage them as needed.

## Get One Specific Pinning Rule

To retrieve a specific pinning rule by its `id`, you can use the `getPin` function. This function returns the details of the specified pinning rule.

```ts
import { getPin } from '@orama/orama'

const rule = getPin(db, 'pin_blue_jeans')
```

This will return the pinning rule with the ID `pin_blue_jeans`, allowing you to view its conditions and consequences.

## Errors

When working with pinning rules, you might encounter the following errors:

- `PINNING_RULE_ALREADY_EXISTS`: This error occurs when you try to create a pinning rule with an `id` that already exists in the database. Each pinning rule must have a unique `id`. To update an existing rule, use the `updatePin` function instead.
- `PINNING_RULE_NOT_FOUND`: This error occurs when you try to update or delete a pinning rule that does not exist in the database. Make sure to provide a valid `id` of an existing rule.
