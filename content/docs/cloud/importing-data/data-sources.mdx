One important concept to understand when working with Orama Cloud, is the concept of **data source**.

A data source, as the name suggests, refers to the original source from which data is derived. This could be a database, a web service, a JSON file, or any other platform that handles and stores your data.

Connecting your data source to Orama Cloud is the first step in creating an index. An index is a collection of documents that you can search through.

## Choosing a data source

When choosing a data source for your Orama Cloud index, consider the following: if you’re looking to test the platform, you can easily upload a [JSON](/) or [CSV](/) file and index its data in just a few clicks.

If you’re looking to integrate Orama Cloud with your app, [CMS](/), or [E-commerce](/) platform, we recommend using a native integration if available.

If your platform is not listed, you can always build a [custom integration](/) using REST APIs.

## Static files

You can easily upload any [JSON](/) or [CSV](/) files and index their data in just a few clicks.

This feature is particularly useful when you want to test an Orama Cloud indexes with a **database dump** or a **spreadsheet export**.

## Native integrations

Orama Cloud offers a rich variety of Native integrations and plugins that helps you integrate with your app with ease. When available, we suggest using native integrations over custom integrations, as they are highly optimized and provide a better developer experience, performance, and maintainability.

Integrating is very straight-forward. Install the plugin for your application, CMS or E-commerce platform. If your platform is not listed, you can always build a custom integration using REST APIs.

## Custom Integrations

If you need to regularly update the Orama Cloud index for production-grade workflows, or on a demand basis, we highly recommend considering feeding your index via [REST APIs](/).

By utilizing this data source, you can decide when to redeploy the index or only update a segment of it. Typically, you might set up a cron job to periodically update the index based on your needs. You also trigger deployments on demand.

## Other data sources

If you are looking for an alternative data source to integrate with Orama Cloud, you can use our [Web Crawler](/) to index the contents of your website. This is particularly useful when you want to index a website that does not provide an API.
