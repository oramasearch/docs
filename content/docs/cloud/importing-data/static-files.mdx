You can easily upload any JSON or CSV files and index their data in just a few clicks. This feature is particularly useful when you want to test an Orama Cloud indexes with a database dump or a spreadsheet export.

<div className='grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8'>
  <ImageCTA
    title="JSON File"
    description="Import a JSON file from your computer"
    image="/docs/cloud/json-file.webp"
    href="/docs/cloud/data-sources/static-files/json-file"
  />
  <ImageCTA
    title="CSV File"

    href="/docs/cloud/data-sources/static-files/csv-file"
  />
</div>

## Updating the index

Once a static file is uploaded, it will remain in the index until you upload a new file. This means that if you want to update the index with new data, you will need to upload a new file. The old file will be replaced with the new one, and the collection will be updated accordingly.
