**Orama UI** is a composable, unstyled React component library designed for building AI-driven interfaces powered by Orama. Whether you’re adding a **chat assistant**, **smart search**, or **custom AI-powered workflows**, this library gives you the headless building blocks you need. No styling or UI lock-in.

It provides:

- **⚡ Headless components**: unstyled primitives ready for your design system.
- **🪝 Hooks**: utilities for managing AI queries, chat state, and search pipelines.
- **🌐 Context providers**: to handle global state across assistants, messages, or search results.

Use it with your favorite UI framework (Tailwind, shadcn, Material UI, custom CSS) while focusing on functionality, not boilerplate.
