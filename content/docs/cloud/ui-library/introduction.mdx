**Orama UI** is a composable, unstyled React component library designed for building AI-driven interfaces powered by Orama. Whether you‚Äôre adding a **chat assistant**, **smart search**, or **custom AI-powered workflows**, this library gives you the headless building blocks you need. No styling or UI lock-in.

It provides:

- **‚ö° Headless components**: unstyled primitives ready for your design system.
- **ü™ù Hooks**: utilities for managing AI queries, chat state, and search functionality.
- **üåê Context providers**: to handle global state across assistants, messages, or search results.

Use it with your favorite UI framework (Tailwind, shadcn, Material UI, custom CSS) while focusing on functionality, not boilerplate.

## Get started

Orama UI is designed to work with [Orama Cloud](https://app.orama.com) projects. You'll need an active account and project set up on the Orama Cloud platform before using the library. 
First time with Orama Cloud? Read the documentation to [create a project in Orama Cloud](/docs/cloud/projects/create).

Once you have created your project and uploaded your data, you can grab the **Project ID** and **Read-Only API Key** from the Orama Cloud dashboard. These credentials will be used to configure the Orama UI components, so keep them handy and let‚Äôs get started!

## Installation
Install the required packages:

```bash
npm install @orama/ui @orama/client
# or
yarn add @orama/ui @orama/client
# or
pnpm add @orama/ui @orama/client
```

## Set up
Import the Orama JavaScript client and create your instance using your Cloud project configuration:

```javascript
import { OramaCloud } from '@orama/client';

const orama = new Orama({
  projectId: 'your-project-id',
  apiKey: 'your-read-only-api-key',
});
```

## Usage
Import and use the components:

```javascript
import {
  SearchRoot,
  SearchInput,
  SearchResults,
} from "@orama/ui/components";

<SearchRoot client={orama}>
  <SearchInput.Input placeholder="Search for anything..." />
  <SearchResults.Wrapper>
    <SearchResults.List>
      {(result) => (
        <SearchResults.Item>
          <h3>{result.title}</h3>
          <p>{result.description}</p>
        </SearchResults.Item>
      )}
    </SearchResults.List>
  </SearchResults.Wrapper>
</SearchRoot>
```

## Styling
Style as you wish! Orama UI components are unstyled by default. Use your own CSS, Tailwind, styled-components, or any styling solution.

> Please note that, while Orama UI components are unstyled, some layout components may require minimal styling to function properly. If you choose to use a layout component (i.e. `SlidingPanel`), ensure you import the `styles.css` file provided in the library for basic layout support.

```javascript
import "@orama/ui/styles.css"
```
