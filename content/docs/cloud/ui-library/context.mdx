# Contexts

Orama UI provides React contexts that enable direct control over search and chat state management. These contexts are the foundation upon which the components like `SearchRoot` and `ChatRoot` are built.

## When to Use Contexts

**You typically don't need to use these contexts directly.** The `SearchRoot` and `ChatRoot` components provide all the functionality most applications need, with simplified APIs and built-in state management.

However, contexts become useful when you need fine-grained control over state, want to build custom components, or have specific requirements that the root components don't cover.

## Available Contexts

### Search Context

**[`SearchContext`](https://github.com/oramasearch/orama-ui/blob/main/packages/ui/docs/context/SearchContext.md)** - Provides search state and functionality to child components

The SearchContext manages all search-related state including:
- Search client instance
- Current search terms and results
- Facet selections and counts
- Search dispatch actions

### Chat Context

**[`ChatContext`](https://github.com/oramasearch/orama-ui/blob/main/packages/ui/docs/context/ChatContext.md)** - Manages chat state, conversation history, and AI responses

The ChatContext handles all chat-related functionality including:
- Chat client instance
- User prompts and interactions
- Answer sessions and streaming
- Conversation history management

Both contexts follow a similar pattern using React's `useReducer` pattern. Each context exposes:

- State context: access to current state
- Dispatch context: Functions to update state
- Custom hooks: Convenient access to both state and dispatch
- Reducer: State management logic
- Initial state: Default values


This architecture ensures predictable state updates and makes it easy to reason about how data flows through your application.
