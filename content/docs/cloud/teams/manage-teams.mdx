When creating a new account on Orama Cloud, you will be automatically assigned to a new team, which takes your first name as its name.

For instance, my name is "Michele", so I am automatically assigned to a team named "Michele's Team", and I am the owner. I can invite new team members to join my team at any time or create a new team.

## Managing Teams

You can switch between teams by clicking on the team name in the top left corner of the page:

![Change Team](/docs/cloud/teams/change-team.png)

You will always have access to this select in all pages of the platform.

## Create a New Team

You can create a new team by clicking on your current team name in the top left corner of the page, then selecting "Create New Team".

A modal will appear, where you can enter the name of your new team:

After creating the team, you will be automatically assigned as the admin of the new team, and you will be redirected to the new team's settings page, where you can manage your team's settings and members:

To invite a new team member, simply click on the "Invite Member" button and add their email address. They will receive an email with a link to join your team.

If they have an Orama Cloud account, they will join your team automatically. Otherwise, they will be asked to create a new account first, then they will be automatically added to your team.
