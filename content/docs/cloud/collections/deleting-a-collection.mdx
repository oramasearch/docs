title: Deleting a Collection
description: What happens when you delete a collection in your project?
---

You can always delete a collection in your project. However, deleting a collection is a permanent action and cannot be undone. When you delete a collection, the following happens:

- All documents in the collection are deleted.
- All data sources and their data associated with the collection are deleted.
- All collection settings are deleted.
- All triggers, segments, and system prompts associated with the collection are deleted.

Although we keep backups of this data, it will not be possible for us to manually restore a collection once it has been deleted.

If you'd like to proceed, click on "Delete Collection" in the left sidebar of the collection settings page. A confirmation dialog will appear, asking you to confirm that you want to delete the collection. If you are sure, click "Delete" to proceed.
