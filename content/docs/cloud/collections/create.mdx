description: Create a collection in Orama Cloud

Once you have signed up for Orama Cloud, you can create a collection. A collection is a set of data sources that you want to use for RAG, search, or any other method of retrieval.

If you're not familiar with the concept of collections, check out the [introduction to Orama Cloud](/docs/cloud#collections) for more information.

## Create a collection

The first time you log in to Orama Cloud, you will see an empty projects window. Click on the **Create a project** button to create your first project. A project is a set of collections.

When asked, insert a project name and click on **Create project**. You will be redirected to the project page, which will look like this:

At this point, you can create your first collection. Once you click on the **Create a collection** button, you will be asked to insert a name for your collection and select the language and embedding model you want to use. You can also add an optional description to help you identify the collection later.

<Callout type='warn'>
At the time of writing, you will not be able to change the language of the collection after it has been created. This will be enabled in a future release and will work for all existing collections.

Once you have filled in the required fields, click on **Create collection**. You will be redirected to the collection page, which will look like this:

Congratulations! You have created your first collection. Now you can start adding data sources to it, but we will cover that in the [data source](/docs/cloud/getting-started/data-sources) section.
