At the time of writing, the REST APIs are private and can only be accessed by authorized users. However, we are working on making them public and accessible to all users.

You can either use the [Official SDKs](/docs/cloud/data-sources/rest-APIs/official-SDK/introduction) or contact us at [info@orama.com](mailto:info@orama.com) if you want early access to the REST APIs.
