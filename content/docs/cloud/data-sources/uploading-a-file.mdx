Sometimes it is just easier to export your data from any system into a JSON, JSONL, CSV, or XML file, and then upload it to Orama Cloud.

You can do so by heading to the **Data Sources** section of your project and clicking `Connect to Data Source`:

![Create Data Source](/docs/cloud/data-sources/create-data-source.png)

Here you can choose which data source you want to connect to. For this specific guide, we will be uploading a JSON file. If you want to follow along, you can download the following [simple JSON file](/docs/cloud/data-sources/movies-database.json), which contains about 1000 movies in JSON format.

Click on `Upload a File` to get started with the upload process.

Once you're in the following page, you can simply drag and drop your file and choose a name and an optional description for your index:

After you've uploaded your file, you will notice that it will be queued for processing. Depending on the size of your file, this process can take a few minutes.

Once the file is processed, you can access it by clicking on its raw in the data sources table, and here you can see a few more important information:

- The data source ID
- The project ID
- The original file name and its size
- Who uploaded it
- When it was uploaded

In case you need support, remember to include the data source ID and the project ID in your message. A simple screenshot of this page will be helpful as well.

## Uploading a new File

In case you need to replace the file with a new one, you can simply click on `upload a new file`. You will be presented with the same file upload page you used to upload the original file, allowing you to upload a new one.

<Callout type='warn'>
Remember that uploading a new file will replace the existing one, and all data associated with it will be lost. This action cannot be undone.
