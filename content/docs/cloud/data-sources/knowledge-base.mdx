description: Store hidden documents to enhance your AI sessions with relevant information.

When performing AI Sessions - such as chatbots, virtual assistants, etc., you may want to access information that should not be publicly available. This is where the Knowledge Base comes in handy.

When creating a new project, Orama Cloud will automatically create an empty Knowledge Base for you.

The **Knowledge Base** is effectively an index, just like any other data source in Orama Cloud, and you can add documents by using the Orama Cloud dashboard.

For example, let's say you want to add context to your AI session about Orama vs a competitor - for the sake of this example, let's assume the competitor is example.ai.

You may want to avoid to publish content that specifically targets competitors, but you still want to instruct the AI to consider the competitor's strengths and weaknesses when compared to your product.

This is a perfect use case for the Knowledge Base:

Once you've added your documents, you will be able to edit or delete them at any time. If you write a lot of documents, you can always search them by keyword or by meaning.
